        The <b>H</b>igh <b>P</b>erformance <b>C</b>omputing <b>P</b>latforms (<b>HPCP</b>) Lab at Yonsei University investigates
        various research topics on computer architecture and system software. Among the research topics, the HPCP Lab places an emphasis
        on designing highly efficient architectural support and system software for emerging applications (e.g., deep learning)
        and computing platforms (e.g., GPUs, mobile SoCs, FPGAs). Our ultimate goal is to design computer architecture and systems
        for the good of great software!
