      <ul>
        <li><b>Processor Performance Analysis &amp; Modeling</b>
          <p align="justify">
            Cycle-level simulations are currently the most widely-used performance evaluation technique, but they are too slow and will become
            much slower as processor microarchitectures become more complex.
            Performance modeling, on the other hand, allows us to quickly predict an application's performance by raising the level
            of abstraction in architectural simulation.
            Furthermore, systems can greatly benefit from performance modeling by being able to predict applications' performance with
            little overheads.
            In this research, we propose faster but accurate performance evaluation methods which can serve as alternatives to the slow cycle-level simulations.
            GCoM [ISCA '22], a fast and accurate analytical model for evaluating the performance of modern GPUs, and
            GCStack&plus;GCScaler [ISCA '25], a fast and accurate GPU performance analysis framework using fine-grained stall cycle accounting and interval analysis,
            are representative outcomes of this research topic.

        <li><b>Hardware-Accelerated Database Management Systems</b>
          <p align="justify">
            Database management systems (DBMSs; e.g., MySQL, MonetDB) are one of the most important server workloads as they allow users to capture and analyze large amounts of data.
            Fast query processing is a key design goal of DBMSs, and we seek to achieve the goal through hardware acceleration.
            In this research, to accelerate query processing, we analyze the key performance bottlenecks of the existing DBMSs and propose
            hardware acceleration techniques which fully exploit the high potential of modern hardware.
            Example outcomes of this topic are PID-Join [SIGMOD '23], a fast in-memory join algorithm exploiting the processing-in-memory capabilities of commodity DIMM devices,
            and SPID-Join [SIGMOD '25], a skew-resistant in-memory join algorithm which achieves high skew resistance by leveraging the architectural characteristics of commodity processing-in-DIMM devices.
            Additional example outcomes include FaScalSQL [ICDE '26], a fast and scalable GPU-accelerated analytical query engine for out-of-memory tables, and DMO-DB [PACT '25], which seeks to overcome the data movement bottlenecks of GPU-accelerated analytical query executions.

        <li><b>Next-Generation CPU &amp; GPU Architectures for General-Purpose Computing</b>
          <p align="justify">
            CPU and GPU are the two most widely-deployed processors available on most of desktops, servers, and mobile devices.
            Still, their architectures continue to change as their primary target workloads change over time.
            In this research, we design and propose next-generation CPU and GPU architectures to accomodate the ever-increasing performance demands
            of emerging CPU and GPU workloads.
            We pursue both software- and hardware-oriented approaches by prototyping software-based performance optimizations on real
            CPUs and GPUs, and by evaluating architectural extensions using cycle-level simulators such as gem5 and GPGPU-Sim.
            Examples of this research topic include LATPC [MICRO '25], GPUdmm [HPCA '14], and ScaleGPU [CAL '14].

        <li><b>FPGA-Based Hardware Acceleration</b>
          <p align="justify">
            One of the most rewarding moments as a computer architect is to realize our hardware proposals on real systems.
            It is very difficult to manufacture an actual chip, so we heavily utilize Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) whose functionality can be changed with hardware description languages
            (e.g., Verilog, VHDL).
            By implementing our hardware proposals on FPGAs, we can apply the hardware proposals to real systems
            and demonstrate the real-world effectiveness of the hardware proposals.
            Still, how to implement high-performance FPGA prototypes of the hardware proposals raises various research opportunities which we seek to resolve.
            Notable FPGA prototypes we implemented are DCS [MICRO '15], DCS-ctrl [ISCA '18], and MPC-Wrapper [FCCM '24].

        <li><b>System Software &amp; Hardware Accelerators for Artificial Intelligence</b>
          <p align="justify">
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most important workloads of today;
            however, efficient execution of AI workloads is still a major challenge to both hardware and software.
            In this research, we investigate architectural and system-level support to maximize the performance and/or
            energy efficiency of AI workload execution on various computing platforms.
            We propose new hardware accelerator designs, new AI frameworks to fully utilize the underlying hardware resources,
            and vertical integration methods spanning both hardware and software.
            The research outcomes of this topic include Dataflow Mirroring [IEEE TC '23, DAC '21], SGCN [HPCA '23], GuardiaNN [Middleware '22], and &mu;Layer [EuroSys '19].

        <li><b>Next-Generation GPU Architectures for High-Performance Rasterization &amp; Ray Tracing</b>
          <p align="justify">
            Have you ever wondered how your GPU produces a frame which gets displayed on your monitor?
            Graphics workloads such as games are the primary acceleration target of GPUs, and GPU microarchitectures have been evolved in a way which maximizes throughput to process millions of vertices, primitives (e.g., triangles), fragments, and pixels.
            In this research, we seek to propose new GPU microarchitectures which improve the performance of real-time rasterization and ray tracing, the two most widely-used graphics techniques for implementing rich graphics effects.
            We focus on both rasterization and ray tracing;
            rasterization has been the dominant technique for graphics, whereas ray tracing is becoming more and more popular due to its ability to implement photorealistic frames.
            GPUpd [MICRO '17] is an example outcome of this research topic.
